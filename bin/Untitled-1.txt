When converting the ListNode class into an anonymous inner class within the LinkedListReverse class, we achieve several benefits:
Encapsulation: By defining ListNode as an inner class, it is tightly coupled with LinkedListReverse. This encapsulation indicates that ListNode is only relevant within the context of LinkedListReverse, enhancing code organization.
Access to Outer Class Members: An inner class can access the members (including private members) of its outer class. This can simplify the code if LinkedListReverse needs to interact with ListNode in a way that requires access to its fields or methods.
3. Reduced Namespace Pollution: Defining ListNode as an inner class keeps the global namespace cleaner. It prevents potential naming conflicts with other classes that might be named ListNode in different contexts.
Logical Grouping: It makes the relationship between LinkedListReverse and ListNode explicit. This can improve readability and maintainability, as it is clear that ListNode is a component of the linked list functionality.
Flexibility for Future Changes: If the implementation of ListNode needs to change, having it as an inner class allows for easier modifications without affecting other parts of the codebase.
