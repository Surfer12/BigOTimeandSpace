    <h1>Analysis of Insertion and Selection Sort Algorithms and Their Respective Implementations</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document provides an enhanced analysis of the Insertion Sort and Selection Sort algorithms, focusing on their implementations, error handling, performance, and potential optimizations.</p>

    <h2>Sorting Algorithm Overview</h2>
    <p>"Sorting is a very classic problem of reordering items (that can be compared, e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc) of an array (or a list) in a certain order (increasing, non-decreasing (increasing or flat), decreasing, non-increasing (decreasing or flat), lexicographical, etc)." (VisualAlgo)</p>

    <h2>Insertion Sort: Psuedocode</h2>
    <pre>
mark first element as sorted

for each unsorted element X

  'extract' the element X

  for j = lastSortedIndex down to 0

    if current element j > X

      move sorted element to the right by 1

    break loop and insert X here
    </pre>
    <p>(VisualAlgo)</p>

    <h2>Insertion Sort: Implementation</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-java">
/**
 * Performs an insertion sort on the provided array.
 *
 * This method sorts the array in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.
 * It iterates through each element, inserting it into the correct position within the
 * already sorted portion of the array.
 *
 * @param anArray the array to be sorted; must not be null or empty
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the input array is null or empty
 */
public static void insertionSort(int[] anArray) {
    if (anArray == null || anArray.length == 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input array must not be null or empty"); 
    }

    int n = anArray.length; 

    // Outer loop: Iterates from the second element to the last, considering each as the 'key' to insert
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) { 
        int key = anArray[i]; 
        int j = i - 1; 

        // This code segment selects the current element to be inserted into the sorted subarray
        System.out.println("Insertion Sort - Key selected: " + key);

        // Shift elements greater than 'key' one position to the right
        while (j >= 0 && anArray[j] > key) { 
            anArray[j + 1] = anArray[j]; 
            // Move 'j' one position to the left
            j = j - 1; 

            System.out.println("Insertion Sort - Array after shifting: " + Arrays.toString(anArray));
        }

        // Continue shifting until the correct insertion point for 'key' is found
        anArray[j + 1] = key; 
        System.out.println("Insertion Sort - Array after inserting key: " + Arrays.toString(anArray));
    }
}
</code></pre>

    <h2>Time Complexity and Space Complexity Analysis of Insertion Sort</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time Complexity</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Best Case: O(n) - This occurs when the array is already sorted. In this scenario, Insertion Sort only needs to iterate through the array once to confirm it's already sorted, resulting in a linear time complexity.</li>
                <li>Worst Case: O(n<sup>2</sup>) - This occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order. In this scenario, Insertion Sort needs to perform the maximum number of comparisons and swaps, leading to a quadratic time complexity.</li>
                <li>Average Case: O(n<sup>2</sup>) - The average case time complexity of Insertion Sort is also O(n<sup>2</sup>), which is the same as the worst-case scenario. This is because the algorithm's performance is heavily influenced by the initial order of the array, leading to approximately half the comparisons and shifts compared to the worst case, but still resulting in a quadratic time complexity overall as this is a nested loop.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Space Complexity</strong>: O(1) - Insertion Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm meaning it does not require any additional space proportional to the input size. Insertion sort alters the array by shifting elements within the array itself, without creating a new array or using significant extra memory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stability of Insertion Sort</h2>
    <p>Insertion Sort is a stable sort. This means that if two elements are equal, their relative order is preserved in the sorted output.</p>

    <h2>Error Handling</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Null Handling</strong>: Similar to Insertion Sort, this method throws an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> for null inputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Empty Array Handling</strong>: Similar to Insertion Sort, this method throws an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> for empty arrays.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stability of Selection Sort</h2>
    <p>Selection Sort is not a stable sort. This means that if two elements are equal, their relative order is not guaranteed to be preserved in the sorted output.</p>

    <h2>Key Differences in Time Complexity</h2>
    <p>The time complexity of the algorithms highlights their efficiency differences.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Insertion Sort</strong>: Constructs the sorted portion from left to right by inserting each element into its correct position within the already sorted subarray. This makes Insertion Sort more efficient for small or partially sorted datasets compared to Selection Sort.</li>
        <li><strong>Selection Sort</strong>: Constructs the sorted portion from left to right by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swapping it with the first unsorted element.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Time Complexity Analysis Comparison</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Insertion Sort</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best Case</strong>: O(n) - When the input is already sorted, the algorithm only needs to iterate through the array once, confirming it's sorted.</li>
                <li><strong>Worst/Average Case</strong>: O(n<sup>2</sup>) - When the array is in reverse order or randomly ordered</li>
                <li><strong>Reason</strong>: It builds the sorted portion incrementally, inserting elements as needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Selection Sort</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Best Case</strong>: O(n<sup>2</sup>) - Even if the input is sorted, the algorithm must still iterate through the entire array for each element in the unsorted portion.</li>
                <li><strong>Reason</strong>: It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion, requiring full traversal for each selection.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Insertion Sort and Selection Sort have different performance characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Insertion Sort performs well on small datasets or partially sorted arrays. It's adaptive, meaning it can take advantage of existing order in the input.</li>
        <li>Selection Sort always performs the same number of comparisons, regardless of the initial order of the array. This makes it less efficient for partially sorted arrays.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenarios where Insertion Sort outperforms Selection Sort:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Small datasets (typically &lt; 10-20 elements)</li>
        <li>Nearly sorted arrays</li>
        <li>When writes are significantly more expensive than reads</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scenarios where Selection Sort might be preferred:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When memory writes are very expensive compared to memory reads</li>
        <li>When simplicity of implementation is a priority</li>
    </ul>
