Additional Improvements:
a. Add time complexity analysis for both algorithms in the main text.
b. Include space complexity analysis.
c. Provide a comparison between the two algorithms, discussing scenarios where one might be preferred over the other.
d. Add visual representations (e.g., flowcharts) to illustrate the algorithms' steps.
e. Include more diverse test cases in the unit testing section.
f. Discuss stability of the sorting algorithms.
g. Add a section on practical applications of these sorting algorithms in real-world scenarios.
UML Diagrams:
The document mentions UML diagrams for both algorithms, but they're not provided. Adding these diagrams would enhance the overall understanding of the algorithms' structure and flow.
Output Logs:
The output logs provided are helpful. Consider adding a brief explanation after each log entry to clarify what's happening at each step.
Performance Optimizations:
Expand on the performance optimization sections. For Insertion Sort, you could discuss the benefits of using binary search to find the insertion point. For Selection Sort, you could mention the possibility of using a heap data structure to improve performance.
Modern Contexts:
The section on relevance in modern contexts is good. You could expand this by providing specific examples or case studies of how these algorithms are used in microservices, reactive systems, and cloud-native applications.
