To make the flowchart wider, you can adjust the graph direction and spacing parameters. However, Mermaid does not provide a direct way to set the diagram width explicitly. Instead, you can influence the spacing and alignment to achieve a wider look by using techniques such as changing the direction of the flow, adding some invisible nodes to force spacing, or even by breaking long labels into shorter ones.

Here's an updated version of your diagram where I will change the graph direction to LR (Left to Right) and break down the subgraph labels to make it wider:

Here, graph LR instead of graph TD changes the rendering direction from top-down to left-right, effectively making the chart wider. Additionally, multiline labels with \n help make nodes narrower and taller, adding to the overall width of the graph.
